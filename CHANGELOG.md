## [1.6.0 - CogniVect Rebrand] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Security Scanner** ([`scripts/security-scan.ps1`](scripts/security-scan.ps1)) — pre-commit security scanning for secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens), vulnerability patterns (SQL injection, XSS, code injection), and license compatibility. Detects AWS keys, GitHub PATs, OpenAI keys, and more.
- **Agent Orchestrator** ([`scripts/agent-orchestrator.ps1`](scripts/agent-orchestrator.ps1)) — hierarchical multi-agent task delegation with automatic agent selection based on task keywords. Includes verification at handoff points to prevent hallucination propagation.
- **MCP Connectors** ([`scripts/mcp-connect.ps1`](scripts/mcp-connect.ps1)) — connect to external tools via MCP: Chrome DevTools, Database explorers, Jira issue trackers, and Monitoring/Observability systems.
- **Smart Git** ([`scripts/smart-git.ps1`](scripts/smart-git.ps1)) — AI-powered git integration with atomic commits, auto-generated commit messages, save points for rollback, and diff visualization.
- **Security Scanner Skill** ([`skills/security/security-scanner/SKILL.md`](skills/security/security-scanner/SKILL.md)) — comprehensive security scanning skill with banned word dictionary and anti-slop checklist.
- **Test-Driven AI Workflow** ([`workflows/test-driven-ai.md`](workflows/test-driven-ai.md)) — automated test generation workflow that generates tests before code, then implements to pass.

### Changed

- **Terminal UI** ([`god-ui.ps1`](god-ui.ps1) v6.0) — added Security Scanner (T), Agent Orchestrator (A), MCP Connectors (M), Smart Git (G) menu items.
- **CLI** ([`god-cli.ps1`](god-cli.ps1) v1.1) — added `security-scan`, `agent-orch`, `mcp-connect`, `smart-git` commands.
- **README** — updated skill count to 88, added Security category, added v1.6.0 features, updated TUI menu table.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **No AI Slop Skill** ([`skills/writing/no-ai-slop/SKILL.md`](skills/writing/no-ai-slop/SKILL.md)) — comprehensive anti-slop skill with banned word dictionary, anti-slop checklist, before/after examples, and concrete formatting rules. Based on web research about AI slop characteristics. Forces authentic, specific, opinionated writing.
- **Technical Documentation Skill** ([`skills/writing/technical-documentation/SKILL.md`](skills/writing/technical-documentation/SKILL.md)) — practical guide for writing READMEs, API docs, ADRs, runbooks, and tutorials that engineers actually read.
- **Code Generation Skill** ([`skills/core/code-generation/SKILL.md`](skills/core/code-generation/SKILL.md)) — production-focused code generation that prioritizes shipping working code with tests, error handling, and pattern matching.
- **CLI Tool** ([`god-cli.ps1`](god-cli.ps1)) — non-interactive command-line interface wrapping all major commands: `install`, `health`, `test`, `code-graph`, `skill-fragment`, `smart-load`, `session`, `wiki-build`, `cursor-export`, `skills-sync`, `status`, `ui`.

### Changed

- **Terminal UI** ([`god-ui.ps1`](god-ui.ps1) v5.0) — replaced ASCII box-drawing (`+`, `-`, `|`) with Unicode characters (`╭`, `╮`, `╰`, `╯`, `─`, `│`).
- **Session Memory** ([`scripts/session-memory.ps1`](scripts/session-memory.ps1)) — fixed PSCustomObject `.ContainsKey()` bug that prevented analytics from working. Converted to hashtable operations.
- **README** — updated skill count to 87, added Writing category, added CLI section, updated TUI version.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Persistent Session Memory** ([`scripts/session-memory.ps1`](scripts/session-memory.ps1)) — cross-session memory system with session context tracking (agents/skills/projects used), usage analytics (frequency counts across sessions), preference learning (auto-detects favorites), and conversation continuity (`-Recall` shows last session context). Writes to `memory/session.json` and `memory/analytics.json`.
- **Wiki Auto-Builder** ([`scripts/build-wiki.ps1`](scripts/build-wiki.ps1)) — generates comprehensive reference pages from skill, agent, and workflow content. Outputs `docs/wiki/skills-reference.md`, `agents-reference.md`, and `workflows-reference.md` with overview tables and detailed per-item sections. Wired into wiki CI pipeline.
- **Native Bash Installer** ([`install.sh`](install.sh) v2.0) — full native bash installer with no PowerShell dependency. Supports Linux, macOS, WSL, and Git Bash. Features: interactive/`--yes`/`--status`/`--uninstall` modes, full skills/agents/workflows/commands install, opencode.json merge, color output.
- **Multi-Language Code Graph** ([`scripts/code-graph.ps1`](scripts/code-graph.ps1) v2.0) — extended to support 6 languages: PowerShell, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. Language-specific comment stripping, function definition regexes, and call detection. Use `-Languages "py,js,ts"` to scan specific languages.
- **Smart Skill Loader** ([`scripts/smart-loader.ps1`](scripts/smart-loader.ps1)) — context-aware section extraction with TF-IDF-like relevance scoring, exact-phrase bonuses, context-aware token weighting, and LRU cache for fast repeated queries. Extracts individual `##` sections from SKILL.md files rather than returning whole files.

### Changed

- **Terminal UI** ([`god-ui.ps1`](god-ui.ps1) v4.0) — added `[S] Session Memory`, `[W] Wiki Builder` menu items. Updated existing items to reflect multi-language code graph and native bash installer.
- **Browser dashboard** ([`ui/index.html`](ui/index.html)) — added v1.4.0 announcement banner with 5 feature cards.
- **README** — added v1.4.0 release badge, "What's New in v1.4.0" section with usage examples, updated Architecture Features table to show all concerns resolved, updated TUI menu table.

### Notes

- All 5 original roadmap concerns are now fully addressed with working MVPs.
- `install.sh` is now a complete native installer (v1.0 delegated to pwsh; v2.0 is pure bash).
- Code graph supports PS, Python, JS, TS, Go, Rust — configurable via `-Languages` flag.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **JSON Schema for `opencode.json`** ([`schemas/opencode.schema.json`](schemas/opencode.schema.json)) — Draft 2020-12 with `patternProperties` for agent / command / mcp_servers keys, `additionalProperties: false` at the top, conditional `then:` clauses for MCP transport, and `mcp_servers.snippets` examples. Editors (Cursor, VS Code) auto-lint `opencode.json` against it via the `$schema` reference.
- **MCP-to-skill bridge** ([`scripts/mcp-to-skill.ps1`](scripts/mcp-to-skill.ps1)) — reads `opencode.json#mcp_servers`, emits `skills/<category>/mcp-<name>/SKILL.md` wrappers, and is invoked at the end of `install.ps1`. Five MCP servers (filesystem, github, playwright, context7, tavily) ship out of the box as both MCP clients and skills.
- **Skills Registry spec + CLI** ([`skills-REGISTRY.md`](skills-REGISTRY.md), [`registry-sources.txt`](registry-sources.txt), [`scripts/install-skill.ps1`](scripts/install-skill.ps1) `-Sync`) — canonical cross-repo skill registry. `install-skill.ps1 -Sync` shallow-clones the top-N entries from `registry-sources.txt` into `skills-mirror/`.
- **Workflow shape tests** ([`tests/unit/Test-Workflows.Tests.ps1`](tests/unit/Test-Workflows.Tests.ps1)) — first-run Pester assertions: every `workflows/*.md` must have an H1 matching its filename, `## Purpose`, `## Parameters`, and `### Step N` sections. Cross-references each step's `Agent:` against `agents/` and `Skills:` against `skills/` (category-aware fallback).
- **Cursor / Windsurf / Aider drop-in exporter** ([`scripts/export-cursorrules.ps1`](scripts/export-cursorrules.ps1), `install-skill.ps1 -Use cursorrules`) — converts `agents/<name>/AGENT.md` into the `.cursorrules` YAML frontmatter schema. One command writes a `.cursorrules` per agent into `dist/cursorrules/`; copy one into your project and any Cursor/Windsurf/Aider session picks up the persona.
- **Live skill/agent/workflow graph** ([`scripts/build-skill-graph.ps1`](scripts/build-skill-graph.ps1)) — emits `docs/wiki/_data/architecture.mmd` (Mermaid) on every wiki CI run. Edges reflect the actual `## Skills` blocks in each agent and the `### Step N: Agent / Skills` blocks in each workflow. Wiki auto-renders the graph.

### Changed

- **Terminal UI** ([`god-ui.ps1`](god-ui.ps1)) — added `[L] Live Architecture`, `[R] Skills Registry`, `[C] Cursor Export`, `[N] What's new in v1.3.0` menu items. Updated the architecture features status block.
- **Browser dashboard** ([`ui/index.html`](ui/index.html)) — added a v1.3.0 announcement banner / card and section anchors linking to the new features.
- **`install-skill.ps1`** — added `-Sync`, `-TopN`, `-Use` dispatchers; existing `-Path`/`-Source`/`-Version` behaviour preserved verbatim.
- **`install.ps1`** — `mcp_servers` merge uses a local `$McpMerged` flag (no longer re-serializes the global config on every install when nothing changed).
- **README** — added "🆕 What's New in v1.3.0" section, "Use with Cursor", "Aggregate skills from anywhere" subsections, and a release badge linking to the v1.3.0 GitHub release.

### Notes

- Releases ship via `git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0`. The `release.yml` workflow runs `scripts/package-release.ps1 -Version 1.3.0` and attaches `release/god-opencode-v1.3.0.zip` + SHA256SUMS to a GitHub Release.
- Schema validator is not invoked in CI yet — `tests/unit/Test-OpenCodeSchema.Tests.ps1` ships the Pester suite but does not call `jsonschema` (lives outside PowerShell). Future work.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

*(Backfilled — the underlying commit `3f1160d` shipped on the date above but the changelog entry was authored in commit `eb06e71` to keep the README self-consistent.)*

### Added

- **Architectural feature pack** addressing the four open concerns documented in `docs/wiki/roadmap.md`:
  - **Code Graph** (`scripts/code-graph.ps1`) — PowerShell call-graph extractor that scans `*.ps1`/`*.psm1` and emits `docs/wiki/_data/code-graph.json` (nodes + edges + per-file references). Render in `docs/wiki/graph.md`.
  - **Dynamic Skills** (`scripts/skill-fragment.ps1`) — query-time skill selector that returns matching `##` sections per request instead of injecting whole SKILL.md files.
  - **Cross-Platform install matrix** — `install.sh` (bash, delegates to `install.ps1` via `pwsh`) + `install.cmd` (cmd.exe shim) so Linux/macOS/WSL/Windows hosts all reach the same installer.
  - **Long-term Memory** (`scripts/memory.ps1` v1.2) — added `New-MemoryRecall` (top-N token-overlap across `memory/*.md`) and `Get-MemoryPreferences`; convention file `memory/AGENT_PREFERENCES.md` for persistent agent preferences.
- **Wiki** (`docs/wiki/`) — 8 markdown pages: `index.md`, `getting-started.md`, `architecture.md`, `graph.md`, `dynamic-skills.md`, `cross-platform.md`, `memory.md`, `roadmap.md`. Single source of truth for the architectural roadmap.
- **Browser dashboard update** (`ui/index.html`) — added Wiki landing grid, Architecture Features status section, and Wiki nav link.

### Changed

- **Terminal UI** (`god-ui.ps1` v3.0) — global install (`.\install.ps1`) elevated to the default action (Enter keypress). New menu pages: Code Graph (3), Skill Fragment (4), Memory (5), Cross-Platform (6), Wiki (8). Adds an Architecture Features status section that surfaces code-graph / dynamic-skills / cross-platform / memory health. PowerShell 5.1 compatible (no PS7-only constructs).
- **README** — added the **Architectural features (1.2)** section + wiki link table, Project Structure entries for `docs/wiki/` and `memory/`, and a "Press Enter to install globally" quick-start note.
- **`.gitignore`** — excludes local memory artifacts (`memory/*`) while keeping `memory/AGENT_PREFERENCES.md` tracked (whitelist pattern).
- **Wiki Pages workflow** (`.github/workflows/wiki-pages.yml`) — switched from `mkdocs gh-deploy --force --clean` (which required a `gh-pages` branch) to the official `actions/deploy-pages@v4` + `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` + `actions/configure-pages@v5` stack. Two-job pipeline (`build` → `deploy` with `needs`), `pages: write` + `id-token: write` OIDC permissions, no branch requirement. Pinned `mkdocs-material~=9.5.0` + `mkdocs~=1.6.0`. Users now enable Pages via **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** (no branch selection needed).

### Notes

- No new agents, workflows, or commands — all additions are tooling + docs.
- The skill headline count stays at **84 unique** across 11 topical categories — each skill lives in exactly one category folder, so per-category counts sum to 84 exactly.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Documentation** (`docs/`) — New architecture, standards, and workflow authoring guides.
  - `docs/architecture.md` — System overview, three-layer architecture, and OpenCode integration points.
  - `docs/standards.md` — PowerShell 5.1 compatibility, SKILL.md format, workflow syntax, and Markdown conventions.
  - `docs/workflows.md` — Workflow authoring guide with parameter substitution and examples.
- **OpenCode Configuration** (`opencode.json`) — Added `permission` rules to restrict destructive bash commands, per-agent `tools` restrictions, and glob-based `instructions`.
- **Installer v2.2** (`install.ps1`) — Added merge support for `permission` fields and glob `instructions` when merging into the global OpenCode config.
- **GitHub Release Automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — Triggered on `v*` tag pushes, creates a GitHub Release, and attaches the packaged `.zip` asset with auto-generated release notes.
- **Local Release Packager** (`scripts/package-release.ps1`) — Builds a versioned `.zip` release package locally with all components.

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md** — Added build/test/health commands section and contribution workflow.
- **`.gitignore`** — Ignores `*.zip` release packages and `release/` directory.
